--- Section 1: Installing ---

Q: How do I install Allegttf?

A: That depends on your platform.

   --DJGPP--

   1) run "make"
   2) copy libalttf.a to your DJGPP lib directory and include/allegttf.h to 
      your DJGPP include directory.

   --Linux--

   1) run "make"
   2) copy libalttf.a to /usr/local/lib and include/allegttf.h to 
      /usr/local/include

   --MinGW32 static version--

   1) run "make"
   2) copy libalttf.a to your MINGW32 lib directory and include/allegttf.h to 
      your MINGW32 include directory.


--- Section 2: Rebuilding ---

Q: After I installed the latest version of Allegro, Allegttf doesn't work 
   anymore..

A: Allegttf depends on the Allegro header files.  If Allegro gets a new
   version you have to rebuild and reinstall Allegttf.  


--- Section 3: Bugs ---

Q: I think I found a bug.  How do I get you to fix it?

A: Well, you have to tell me as much as possible about where the bug occurs
   and under what conditions it shows up.  There are two approaches:

   1: Send me the smallest amount of code that procuces the bug.

   2: Fix it yourself and send me the fixed source code.

   Of course I'd prefer that you did all of these things, especially number 2.
   You can send the bug to my email address, which is mentioned elsewhere in 
   the docs.


Q: The linker complains that it cannot find some Allegro variables while I 
   really did link with Allegttf library and the Allegro library.

A: Did you make sure that you linked to libalttf.a before liballeg.a?  Just 
   remember that the low-level libraries get linked last.  Since libalttf.a
   relies on stuff from liballeg.a and therefore must be linked first.  If
   in doubt, look at the order of the libraries in the examples.

Q: I downloaded a font from the web and Allegttf doesn't print it out 
   correctly.

A: I really don't know.  Some fonts are pretty poor quality and probably 
   use some weird unicode stuff that I don't understand. sorry.


--- Section 4: Using Allegttf ---

Q: How to I print a font in bold or italics.

A: You can't yet.  You go find a font that looks like the font, but is bolder
   and use that.  I don't know of any algorithm that bolds/italicices fonts and 
   still lets the font look good.  Of course if you know how to do this you can
   send me some info on the algorithm (or send me some code) and I'll include 
   it in the next version along with a great big thanks to you.


--- Section 4: Resources ---

Q: Where can I find freeware and shareware truetype fonts to use with Allegttf?

A: Oh man, there are thousands of them.  Do a web search with the words "free 
   ttf font" and you should find enough links to make you sick.
