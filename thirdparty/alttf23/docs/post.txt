Announce: AllegTTF version 2.3 available

What is ALLEGTTF?

ALLEGTTF is a collection of functions to produce anti-aliased text
output and TTF (True Type Font) loader, a GRX font loader and a bitmap
font loader for use with Allegro and DJGPP.   Antialiased text means
that fonts have 'soft' edges and blend into their backgrounds smoothly.
Antialiased fonts are useful because the look a lot better than
non-antialiased fonts, expecially at low resolutions/point sizes.

Version 2.3 is a minor cleanup over 2.2
